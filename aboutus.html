                        SKATING Magazine

                        SKATING is the official publication of U.S. Figure Skating and is considered one of the sport's premier magazines.
                        
                        SKATING boasts a subscription list of more than 43,000 and a readership of more than 130,000.
                        
                        The magazine, which is published 10 times per year, is a full-color, newsstand-quality publication available to all U.S. Figure Skating members and subscribers. It is also available through the U.S. Figure Skating Publications App, which is available for free for Apple, Android and Kindle Fire users. To download the Publications App, go to iTunes Store or Google Play Store and search "U.S. Figure Skating."
                        
                        SKATING is in its 95th year of publication and features news and profiles on national skaters, reports on national, international and Olympic events, articles on fitness and training, sponsor news, event schedules, ticket information and results. The magazine also covers all levels of skating, from grass roots to adult and synchronized skating. 
                        
                        SKATING is also featured on U.S. Figure Skating Online. In addition to highlights from the current issue, past issues of SKATING magazine are available in the archive area. SKATING advertisers are also featured online.
                        
                        In May 2013, U.S. Figure SKATING launched the SKATING magazine Archive, a fully searchable digital database that allows members and subscribers to access every story and photo published in the magazine since the inaugural December 1923 edition.</h1>
